# homework_02 : Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio

This project was built to expressly cover three distinct page design variations for a common portfolio website. This includes an about me/biographical page, a contact me form, and a portfolio of images. Using the bootstrap grid layout as well as HTML styling, these pages were made responsive in order to adjust to window size variations as well as device viewport settings and specs. 

The most successful websites are able to be viewed and utlitized regardless of the device they appear on, so by utilizing these stylistic and design developments in bootstrap, these goals are able to be obtained. 



Built With

Bootstrap
HTML 
CSS


Open issues:
on index.html 
1. card body hugs left boundary of window, adjusting margins changes card layout 
2. Footer does not stick to bottom of window, only hugs bottom of content container (on all pages) 

portfolio.html
1. card layout width too wide for appearance
2. in mobile view, images exceed card boundary with left margin 
3. image gutters too small
